# Project-3

## Project_3_neural_net.ipynb: 
## An attempt to forecast 'S&P/ASX - 200(TR)m' index monthly change using all features data in the file 'Australian_Data_Mod.xlsx' excluding index data.

## Project_3_neural_net.nab.ipynb: 
## An attempt to forecast 'S&P/ASX - 200(TR)m' index monthly change using NAB survey data from the file 'Australian_Data_Mod.xlsx'.

## Project_3_neural_net.wbc.ipynb: 
## An attempt to forecast 'S&P/ASX - 200(TR)m' index monthly change using WBC survey data from the file 'Australian_Data_Mod.xlsx'.

## Project_3_neural_net.g3.ipynb: 
## An attempt to forecast 'S&P/ASX - 200(TR)m' index monthly change using selected macro economic data from the file 'Australian_Data_Mod.xlsx'.

## None of the attempts were successful. Wheras the neural net appeared to converge, attempts to display convincing evidence of significance were failures.
